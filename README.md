DuplexMVVM
==========
***
What is Duplex?
---------------
Duplex is an MVVM framework for developing realtime web application using the MVVM 
pattern, and a full duplex connection between the browser and server.

Duplex is currently in it's humble beginnings and at this stage is little more than
a proof of concept, however, it is a pretty cool example so download it and check it 
out if you like.

Built on the sholders of giants
-------------------------------
Duplex is build using some of the most amaizing new technologies.
> 1. [SignalR](https://github.com/SignalR/SignalR) handles the connectivity between the 
>     browser and server.Easily my favorite Open Sorce project right now. 
> 2. [Knockout](http://knockoutjs.com/) this javacript library handles atomatic binding on the client side, also truley remarkable. 
>    if you are a web developer this library will really make you life better.
> 3. [Reactive Extentions](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/data/gg577609) This if the future of 
>	 asyncronous programming on the .NET platform. If you don't know about it now you will soon.
>	 Rx has both a server side and client side library that allows you to write link queries 
>    against asyncronous streams of data (to put it mildly).

My Goal
--------
The combination of these technologies creats truley amaizing results, and the goal of DuplexMVVM
is to crate a layer of abstraction that will both reduce the learning curve, 
and provide a powerful framework for building realtime applications for the web.
